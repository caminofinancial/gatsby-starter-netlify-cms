#### Guest Speaker bio - Kisa Brostrom:
I am not your traditional data scientist. I actually have no formal education in data or computer science; instead I graduated with my Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering with every intention of becoming a rocket scientist. I was thrust into the world of data quite accidentally when I went work for Rolls-Royce right after college as a data engineering/analyst hybrid. Through the genius of Google, I taught myself everything from computer programming to data science. There I worked the full stack data science experience from data engineering through front end web application development. That growth propelled me forward through several other companies, where I served as Senior Data Scientist and Head of Analytics specializing in building data new data platforms, data portfolios, and data teams from scratch. I worked in the media industry, the healthcare industry, and the aerospace industry to name a few. Recently I joined boodleAI, a people-focused analytics and data science platform, as VP of Data. Having taught myself data science, I’m most passionate about data culture and improving data literacy within companies through education. Outside of work, I’m a wife to my husband of 8 years, the mother of 3 beautiful girls (including one newborn) and lover all things dance and music.
